# ***CSE476 Final Project***

## How to reproduce my results:
### Important Files:
- finalProject_NilayKumar.py (NOT the .ipynb notebook)
- cse_476_final_project_test_data.json
- generate_final_answers.py
- any json output file

### Steps:
- Make sure you have just `[]` in your output json file
- Run generate_final_answers.py

If it ever steps in the middle of execution, you can start it again and it'll continue where it left off
