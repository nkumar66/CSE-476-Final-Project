# **CSE476 Final Project**

## How to reproduce my results:
### Important Files:
- finalProject_NilayKumar.py (NOT the .ipynb notebook)
- cse_476_final_project_test_data.json
- generate_final_answers.py
- any json output file

### Steps:
- Make sure you have just `[]` in your output json file
- Run generate_final_answers.py

If it ever steps in the middle of execution, you can start it again and it'll continue where it left off
If you ever want to double check any questions to see how well the answer came out, stop execution from the generate_final_answer.py and run random_check.py
If you want to check how accurate your responses are on questions that are not from the test data, run evalOnDev.py
